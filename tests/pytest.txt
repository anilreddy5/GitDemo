# any pytest file should start wiyj test_ or end with _test
# pytest method names should start with test
# any code should be in wrapped only
# to print all the test at the sametime in the command window use py.test
# if you want to see more information on executing the test use py.test -v
# if you want to see the output use py.test -v -s

# we cannot pass same names for two test cases in the same file
# if you want execute only one test case file, define the file name in the command, use py.test test_demo1.py -v -s
# if you want to run the test case from different files, make sure to create the test cases with common name in it then call it with that regular expression,
use py.test -k creditcard -v -s

# Method info should have some sense
# -k stands for method names execution, -s logs in output, -v stands for more info metadata
# you can run specific file with py.test <filename>

# you can mark (tag) tests with @pytest.mark.smoke and then run with -m

# you can skip tests with @pytest.mark.skip

# if you don't want a report to run the use @pytest.mark.xfail

#fistures are used as setup and tear down methods fro test cases- conftest file to generalize fixture and make it available to all test cases

# Datadriven and parameterisation can be done with return statements in tuple format

# when you define fixture scope to class only, it will run once before class is initiated at the end

# to generate html report use py.test --html=report.html -v -s
